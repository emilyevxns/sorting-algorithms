This directory contains the java source files for a project to implement array
sorting.

You must implement 3 different sorting algorithms in this assignment.
Bubble Sort - Sorts by swapping neighbors until no swaps occur
Selection Sort - Sorts by selecting the smallest element each iteration
Merge Sort - Sorts by sorting progressively smaller arrays and merging them

To generate the javadoc for this project:
javadoc -d doc
